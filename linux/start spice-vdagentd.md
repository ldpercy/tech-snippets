Start spice-vdagent for virt-manager guests
===========================================

Conditionally start up spice-vdagent and daemon.

Necessary for getting window resizing and shared clipboard working for linux guests in virt-manager.

Add this to .profile:

```bash
svda_running=$(pgrep --count '[s]pice-vdagentd')
if [ "$svda_running" -eq 0 ]; then
	echo "spice-vdagentd not running; starting now..."
	service spice-vdagent start
	spice-vdagent
else
	echo "spice-vdagentd already running"
fi
```

Without the conditional VSCode tries to rerun this on startup, which prompts authentication, or this error if you take too long:

"Unable to resolve your shell environment in a reasonable time"

N.B. This was for a Kubuntu guest - ymmv
